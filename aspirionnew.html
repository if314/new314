    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p><strong>Redesigning Analyst Work Queue Management at Aspirion</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Company:</strong> Aspirion – a healthcare revenue cycle company<br>
       <strong>Role:</strong> UX Lead<br>
       <strong>Goal:</strong> Redesign the analyst experience to simplify task management, reduce complexity, and support future AI integration</p>
    <p>We transformed Compass from a dense, Excel-like grid into a streamlined platform supporting over 700 analysts across seven service lines. The redesign focused on making the system easier to use, reducing complexity, and future-proofing the tool for continued growth.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p><strong>Manual processes and high complexity</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analysts managed tasks using a complex AG Grid interface</li>
        <li>Required advanced Excel skills, limiting who could be trained</li>
        <li>High training costs and slower onboarding</li>
        <li>System complexity prevented less-experienced users from being productive</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The old interface forced users to think in formulas, not workflows. Managers intervened constantly just to distribute work. The system wasn't built for clarity, autonomy, or modern prioritization needs.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h2>Business Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove AG Grid to reduce reliance on Excel familiarity</li>
        <li>Create a simplified, intuitive UI that lowers the barrier to entry</li>
        <li>Design for a broader, more scalable workforce</li>
        <li>Lay groundwork for automation and AI support</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
    <p><strong>Understanding real workflows</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shadowed analysts across regions and specialties</li>
        <li>Mapped out how users navigated and prioritized work</li>
        <li>Identified key pain points: task duplication, manual prioritization, overwhelming interface</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We uncovered friction from constant context-switching, unreliable filters, and manual tracking. Our mix of interviews, surveys, and data analytics revealed a clear opportunity to reduce cognitive overload and simplify account prioritization.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h2>Design Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Simplify interface and reduce cognitive load</li>
        <li>Support multiple roles and work types</li>
        <li>Enable automated task assignment in the future</li>
        <li>Optimize for speed, clarity, and ease of use</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h2>Key Design Decisions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Removed AG Grid to eliminate Excel-style complexity</li>
        <li>Introduced a card-based queue view with clear task hierarchy</li>
        <li>Designed dynamic filters and role-based views</li>
        <li>Integrated feedback from analysts into every iteration</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We replaced filters with a query builder, grid views with cards, and added visual progress feedback. These updates gave analysts instant clarity on what to do and empowered managers with shareable, flexible oversight.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h2>Impact & Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduced time-to-proficiency by 22%</li>
        <li>Cut manual sorting and assignment by introducing smarter defaults</li>
        <li>Made the tool usable by less-specialized staff, reducing future labor costs</li>
        <li>Provided a scalable foundation for AI queue management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prototypes were validated live with users. Feedback led to improved terminology and even clearer interface elements. Overall response was enthusiastic, and rollout adoption exceeded expectations.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Simplifying doesn’t mean dumbing down—it means removing friction</li>
        <li>Designing for accessibility helps scalability</li>
        <li>Deep user research + iterative design = impactful transformation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I led the entire UX process: from interviewing analysts to mapping user journeys, creating modular design systems, and building interactive prototypes. I worked closely with engineering and leadership to align design with business strategy.</p>
