          <h3 class="mb-0">Surveys</h3>
          <p class="mb-5">Coffee lovers are becoming increasingly aware of the issues with sustainability, cruelty, and lack of fairness around the sources of the coffee they purchase. During our surveys and interviews, we discovered that users are more likely to support businesses that give to charitable causes and enjoy being able to use their purchasing power to contribute. 
            ‍
            <br>Therefore, we believe coffee lovers would enjoy purchasing coffee from a company that allocates a portion of profits to the direct economic growth of the source regions for each product. We might do this by curating ethically sourced, fair-trade, organic coffee at a price point that allows us to partner with local farms to generate programs that contribute to the economic growth of the region in which the coffee is sourced.</p>

        <p class="mb-5">We decided to experiment and split the development between Caitlin Collins and me. She built the home page via Webflow, and I create the shop page and explore page using bootstrap. Combining them was proving difficult, even though we ware adamant about keeping structuring the layout and the CSS classes name the same. We discovered that Webflow exports with presets we are not able to control. So I modified the bootstrap template to match Webflow.

          <p class="mb-5"> Users were given three tasks to complete on the website in order to test the functionality and user experience on the site. These were straightforward tasks such explore information about our farms, shop for coffee, and navigate between the two main areas of our site -- Shop and Explore.

          <p>1. The tasks were for the most part completed with ease. A few respondents couldn’t locate how to discover more about the farms when on the shop page. <br>
            2. Feedback was also solicited on our aesthetics appeal. Improvement was needed in a few areas: 
          </p>
          <ul>
        
           
            
           <li> Consistency in font faces, font weights, and buttons</li>
           <li> More graphically pleasing directionals</li>
           <li> More obvious call outs for learning more about coffee farms on the Explore Page</li>
