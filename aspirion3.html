                Through in-depth user interviews, we gained deeper insights into the intricacies of the system and identified significant issues with training. 
                One key discovery was a prevalent sense of mistrust among new hires towards certain established knowledge channels. Using the maps we created as 
                interview tools, we engaged stakeholders in reflective discussions during these interviews. This process prompted us to reframe the problem and 
                clarify our problem statement, recognizing the need to address the underlying issue of distrust within the training process.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-3">Capture Learninigs</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-3">
                 <p class="lead mb-3">
                    New hires find the training method outdated and struggle to follow it. 
                    They perceive their work as highly significant and harbor apprehensions about making mistakes. 
                    Their lack of trust in the training system stems from its perceived lack of sophistication, 
                    particularly for a technology product. Consequently, they doubt the system's reliability, fearing 
                    that the outdated training method makes the application seem outdated and prone to bugs. 
</p>
<p class="lead mb-3">
    Once an individual join the team on the floor, they typically form relationships and place their trust in specific colleagues, turning to them for questions
    and support. Those who have been with the company for longer periods often underwent training in methods and features different from those highlighted in 
    the new training program. Due to the multitude of training curriculums throw time, tricks, and tips available for completing tasks, users are hesitant to 
    trust just anyone or anything to assist them with a problem. 
</p>

    <br>

            
            <h3 class="mb-3">What changed</h3>
            
                 <p class="lead mb-3">
                    The level of distrust in the training they receive is evident. Each individual typically has one person they consistently rely on: new hires are assigned a buddy, seasoned analysts have their trusted colleague, and so on. Interestingly, as users gain more experience within the system, they tend to place more trust in management and team leads, but not in the beginning.

        <p>We initiated the meeting with stakeholders by reviewing the maps and summarizing our collective learnings. Through co-creation and co-design discussions, we generated ideas to leverage redesigning the system.

 <h3 class="mb-5">Focusing our efforts</h3>
 <p class="mb-5">The user is already familiar with in-app onboarding and training techniques from other applications. I can leverage some of those techniques to enhance the training experience.
 </p>
 <p class="mb-5">Given the user's expertise in in-app onboarding and training, we propose updating our app with techniques from related industries. This initiative represents a medium effort with a potentially high impact. Current discussions within the team involve choosing between integrating an external app for onboarding or developing in-house tooltips and similar features manually.
 

 </p>


 <h3 class="mb-5">Identify a Potential Prototype</h3>
 <p>
    We pinpointed a potential prototype: incorporating in-app guides and onboarding using metrics as our basis. Given users' familiarity with in-app onboarding from other apps, I can utilize similar techniques to enrich the experience.

          <h3 class="mb-0">Objectives</h3>
          <p class="mb-5">As the designer leading the usability testing for the redesigned note feature in the Compass internal application, our objectives were clear: assess how the redesign enhanced readability, usability, 
            and intuitiveness to improve overall user experience. We engaged 32 diverse participants, including newly hired employees and seasoned veterans, in various tasks like reviewing, creating, and applying note templates. 
            Through moderated usability testing, we observed interactions with the redesigned feature in real time, gathering both quantitative and qualitative data. </p>

              <p class="mb-5">We conducted usability testing with diverse participants, considering their experience with Compass and 
                varying roles within the organization. A total of 32 individuals participated in the testing sessions. This group 
                included newly hired employees with less than six months of experience and seasoned veterans with over four years of

              <h3 class="mb-0">Conclusion</h3>
              <p class="mb-5">In conclusion, the note usability test in Compass underscored several key principles essential for effective product design. These include the importance of clear communication, a user-centric approach, continuous iteration, and collaborative efforts. By prioritizing user needs, harmonizing terminology, and involving cross-functional teams, we can create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that meet user expectations and drive business success. Moving forward, we will continue to iterate on our designs, gather user feedback, and refine our processes to deliver exceptional user experiences.
