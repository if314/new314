              Analysts expected immediate access to accounts upon login, but this was not met. Even experienced power users faced difficulties managing their work queues, leading to an 
              opportunity to improve workflow organization and progression for all users. This began a commitment to continuous improvement and excellence in workload and account management.
              <br>
              <br>
              Before diving into the design process, assessing the success and effectiveness of creating and distributing the work queues process on a larger scale was crucial. 
                This involved establishing reliable metrics to measure quality and success. To achieve this, I delved into the concept of an ideal work queue experience and 
                developed a framework that encompassed vital dimensions such as time, ease, and accuracy.</p>

                        To enhance the work queue management experience, we have implemented an intuitive query builder that allows users to effortlessly configure filter and rule setups. This feature enables 
                        analysts to easily select the desired filters and rules to create customized work queue queries. With this powerful tool at their disposal, users can quickly and efficiently define the 
                        criteria for populating their work queues, ensuring they have the most relevant and actionable accounts at their fingertips. The query builder empowers analysts to streamline their workflow, 
                        prioritize tasks effectively, and maximize their productivity.</p>

                          <br>
                          Upon creating a work queue, users have the option to share it with one or multiple individuals. To ensure effective collaboration, if an analyst has accessed a specific account, the 
                          record is automatically locked, and a visual notice indicates that it is currently being viewed. This feature helps maintain data integrity and fosters efficient teamwork within the system.</p>

                            <br>
                            We have crafted an intuitive interface that optimizes the work queue experience for analysts. Analysts are presented with a clear and organized view of the accounts when a 
                            work queue is opened. These accounts are displayed as individual cards on the left side of the page, allowing for easy inspection and navigation. The main space of the page 
                            shows the account that demands immediate action and should be prioritized.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-0">Redesign Inspiration</h3>
            <p>The idea for the redesign comes to me form a user interview. "Energy is the difference between light and dark, warm, and cold." That simple sentence 
              captured the essence of energy, in our opinion. So I decided to center the design to this statement. Kept the original blue and green colors associated with 
              Energy.gov and use them to signify the two main parts of the site "science and education" and "save money."</p>
              <p class="mb-5">I put together an emotional profile of the people I am designing for when going through the research data to assemble the user persona. 
                I realize the majority of our users are environmentally conscious people concern with green source of energy, their carbon footprint, and global warming. 
                So it was a no brainer that the website needed to feel clean, light, and airy. </p>

            <h3 class="mb-0">Moodboard & Inspiration</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">I start the design process with a full understanding of the competition. In this case, researching the 
              web representation of other government departments, as well as other content massive sites catering to the general 
              public like Smashing Magazine, AIGA, Netflix.I also looked at a lot of news sites like The New Yorker and 
              USAtoday. All these websites had in common an established hierarchy and the well-calculated use of white space.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-0">Sketches & ideation</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">I started with paper sketches from scratch, ignoring the original layout of the site. I wanted the logo to be this bright, 
              glowing light embodying the biggest ball of energy we as humanity have seen - the sun. But through talking with collegs and testing with users, I began to understand that energy is more than just light. It is also power. It is a connection. So I moved on to more ambiguous shapes to represent the site.</p>
