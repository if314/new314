        <p class="lead mb-5">As a product designer, I was part of an ambitious project to redesign the distribution and sharing of analyst workloads. We addressed the confusion caused by complex sorting and filtering options and an unintuitive grid dashboard. Through user-centric design and stakeholder collaboration, we successfully improved the workflow, reducing the need for manual processes like receiving Excel sheets via email. </p>

              <p>We phased out Polorase in late 2019 in the past four years we Compass has transformed and grown to have more than 700 analysts in seven different service lines working in Compass. 

                Originally Compass was developed entirely based on Polorase rather than how the analyst used the software to do their jobs. In comparison, the company started using the software predecessor with about 350 analysts servicing four service lines.</p>

However, we are trying to bring the organization into the future and focus on the user's needs. Our ambition was to create a strong base that embraces the analyst process and the rapidly evolving business with a more diverse survice line reach.

              Our high-level goals were to:

  <p>I led the design of the dashboard and the new homepage between October 2022 and May 2023. I collaborated with the head of product development and 2 product managers on the analyst Process, Home Screen, Search, Create, Save, and Share flows.
    In addition, I created a research plan, gathered quantitative and qualitative research, and did the final testing.
    I stopped working on the project during the design system implementation phase as the app was being built.
    The app redesign is to be launched on November 2nd, 2023 </p> <p> Timeline: on going</p>

  <div class="mb-3"> <h3>Discovery</h3></div>
  <p>Determining and configuring workload accounts for analysts proved time-consuming and challenging due to the complex 
    grid-like dashboard view. Analysts expected immediate access to accounts upon login, but this was not met. Even 
    experienced power users faced difficulties in managing their accounts, leading to an opportunity to improve workflow 
    organization and progression for all users. This marked the beginning of a commitment to continuous improvement and excellence in workload management.

  <p>
    <b class="subheading mb-3">Deeper Insights</b>
    Before diving into the design process, assessing the success and effectiveness of the account-assigning method and creating and distributing work queues on a larger scale was crucial. This involved establishing reliable metrics to measure quality and success.
     To achieve this, I delved into the concept of an ideal work queue experience and developed a framework that encompassed key dimensions such as time, ease, and accuracy.

            <p>The idea for the redesign comes to me form a user interview. "Energy is the difference between light and dark, warm, and cold." That simple sentence 
              captured the essence of energy, in our opinion. So I decided to center the design to this statement. Kept the original blue and green colors associated with 
              Energy.gov and use them to signify the two main parts of the site "science and education" and "save money."</p>
              <p class="mb-5">I put together an emotional profile of the people I am designing for when going through the research data to assemble the user persona. 
                I realize the majority of our users are environmentally conscious people concern with green source of energy, their carbon footprint, and global warming. 
                So it was a no brainer that the website needed to feel clean, light, and airy. </p>

            <h3 class="mb-0">Moodboard & Inspiration</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">I start the design process with a full understanding of the competition. In this case, researching the 
              web representation of other government departments, as well as other content massive sites catering to the general 
              public like Smashing Magazine, AIGA, Netflix.I also looked at a lot of news sites like The New Yorker and 
              USAtoday. All these websites had in common an established hierarchy and the well-calculated use of white space.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-0">Sketches & ideation</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">I started with paper sketches from scratch, ignoring the original layout of the site. I wanted the logo to be this bright, 
              glowing light embodying the biggest ball of energy we as humanity have seen - the sun. But through talking with collegs and testing with users, I began to understand that energy is more than just light. It is also power. It is a connection. So I moved on to more ambiguous shapes to represent the site.</p>
