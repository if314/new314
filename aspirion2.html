              Analysts expected immediate access to accounts upon login, but this was not met. Even experienced power users faced difficulties managing their work queues, leading to an 
              opportunity to improve workflow organization and progression for all users. This began a commitment to continuous improvement and excellence in workload and account management.
              <br>
              <br>
              Before diving into the design process, assessing the success and effectiveness of creating and distributing the work queues process on a larger scale was crucial. 
                This involved establishing reliable metrics to measure quality and success. To achieve this, I delved into the concept of an ideal work queue experience and 
                developed a framework that encompassed vital dimensions such as time, ease, and accuracy.</p>

                        <br>
                        To enhance the work queue management experience, we have implemented an intuitive query builder that allows users to effortlessly configure filter and rule setups. This feature enables 
                        analysts to easily select the desired filters and rules to create customized work queue queries. With this powerful tool at their disposal, users can quickly and efficiently define the 
                        criteria for populating their work queues, ensuring they have the most relevant and actionable accounts at their fingertips. The query builder empowers analysts to streamline their workflow, 
                        prioritize tasks effectively, and maximize their productivity.</p>

                          <br>
                          Upon creating a work queue, users have the option to share it with one or multiple individuals. To ensure effective collaboration, if an analyst has accessed a specific account, the 
                          record is automatically locked, and a visual notice indicates that it is currently being viewed. This feature helps maintain data integrity and fosters efficient teamwork within the system.</p>

                            We have crafted an intuitive interface that optimizes the work queue experience for analysts. Analysts are presented with a clear and organized view of the accounts when a 
                            work queue is opened. These accounts are displayed as individual cards on the left side of the page, allowing for easy inspection and navigation. The main space of the page 
                            shows the account that demands immediate action and should be prioritized.</p>
