        <p class="lead mb-5">Arms of love is a nonprofit organization tasked with providing help to people in need, orphanages, and families struggling to make a decent living in the European country of Romania. This nonprofit is relatively new and needs some help getting an online presence. We agree with the stakeholders and respect the decision to have transparency as the primary focus so that more people will be inclined to give.

          <p>To emphasize the transparency of the organization, I decided to introduce campaigns. There will be a start date,
             an end date, and users will know how much money is collected. Users will be able to receive a report on how the 
             funds are used.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5 title">Reaserch</h2>

        <div class="mb-5">
          <p class="mb-5">We started by interviewing the founders, in a 45-minute interview, we had a better understanding of their expectations. They revealed that they need a way for users to donate safely and a way to showcase transparency. From their experience, they get more donations when people trust them and perceive their organization as transparent.
<br><br>
            In addition to interviewing the stakeholders, we conducted four 1-on-1 interviews with potential users. We prepared a total of 16 questions
            and asked the participants to expand upon each answer, providing qualitative data to draw critical insights. Our target demographic was people 
            who have donated before. We wanted their thoughts on the donation process they experienced and their motivations.<br><br>
              Useful quantitative data was collected via an online survey. Forty-six participants completed the study helping us understand the market. </p>

        <p><b>Key Insights</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Donating goods vs. money, people don't have a preference if there is transparency.</li>
          <li>Using different wording for donating buttons.</li>
            <li>Interactive content is prefered.</li>
              <li>The value proposition must be clear and displayed in a prominently.</li>
                <li> Providing options to users for more information.</li>
                  <li> People typically find out about charities from words of mouth.</li>
                    <li>Users want feedback.</li>

        <div class="mb-5">
          <p class="mb-5">As a team, we performed three competitive heuristic analyses of our competitors, global children's organizations, Unicef, and 
            Miracle. To compare and contrast existing and similar nonprofits to find best practices and draw inspiration for the final design. Some of our discoveries include haveing multiple donate buttons on a page that can be perceived as aggressive by the user and off-putting. Unicef address that issue with language - they also had numerous buttons that lead you to donate, but they had different wording.</p>    
          
      <div class="mb-5">
        <p>Patterns positively affecting users:</p>
